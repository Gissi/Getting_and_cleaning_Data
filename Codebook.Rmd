This is an R Markdown document explaining the variables and the data transformed in the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course of the data scientist track on coursera the r script itself can be found in repository as run_analysis.r 

The code itself is pretty well commented so it should be enough to read through it but here I will outline the basic steps i did 

1. Downloaded all the data,create a folder to work in based on relative positions and setting it as a working directory. 
2. Saveing all the data neccesary to finish the project.
* 2.1 First I download the activity labels and add a column names to the data first column = id second Acticity 
* 2.2 Read the test data for the x variable
* 2.3 Read the test data for the y variable
* 2.4 Read the test data for the subject variable
* 2.5 Adding names to the x test data based on the feature file.
* 2.6 I create index from 1 to the length of the files to be sure I Cbind it correctly together -> columns names Index_x
Index_y and Index_s
* 2.7 Name the columns for for the y and subject files, for y -> Training_label, for subject -> subject_number
* 2.8 Only selecting the mean and std variables from the x measurements using grep funciton. 
* 2.9 Column binding the x,y and subject
* 2.10 Checking to see the data.
3. Now doing the same as in 2 with the training data set.
4. Merging the test and the training data together 
5. Fixing the column names for the x measure in the merged data set by removing () and more patterns with sub function. 
6. Rearranging the data and view it with for example 
* head(all_data_m[order(all_data_m$subject_number),1:7])
* tail(all_data_m[order(all_data_m$subject_number),1:7])
* head(all_data_m[order(all_data_m$source,all_data_m$Training_label,all_data_m$row_index),1:7])
7. The columns are 
* row_index -> the index created earlier on all of the rows.
* training_label -> Traning labels numbering from the y measures
* Activity -> training label string explaining the number from the activity label file 
* subject_number -> the number of the subject that is measured
* source -> string explaing where the data came from training vs test
* Other columns are measurement values from the x measure files.
8. Creating new tidy data set as requested in project.
9. installing library needed for using ddply function
10. Tidy data ready as the variable tidy_data columns are
* Activity -> training label string explaining the activity
* subject_number -> the number of the subject that is measured
* rest of the columns are mean of the measurement based on activity and subject.
