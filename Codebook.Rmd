This is an R Markdown document explaining the variables and the data transformed in the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course of the data scientist track on coursera. 


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
